# ANN-Preceptron
Perceptrons are the building blocks of neural networks. It is typically used for supervised learning of binary classifiers.

Preceptron : 
In the modern sense, the perceptron is an algorithm for learning a binary classifier called a threshold function: a function that maps its input  {x}  (a real-valued vector) to an output value f(x) (a single binary value):
